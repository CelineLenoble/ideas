Garden of sound sculpture

An AR apps that let you hear sounds when you visit a garden or any location.

At first, I imagined an art installation in a garden, where the visitor can explore a variety of location in search for lost pieces of music. The user has to view specific locations, angles, etc to unlock the sounds. Some would be very simple to obtain, other might be hidden.

Same process could be used to staged treasure hunts for kids or detective games. The app can become a detector of lost words. Moving around you can pick up dialogs that help you solve a crime.

Next stage would be to release a Make-Your-Own game where users can associate the audio files of their choice to a specific view / location.

No visual integration necessary, except possibly a glow in easy mode to help users locate new sounds.
